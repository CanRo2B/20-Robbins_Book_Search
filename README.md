# Robbins_Book_Search
Unit 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Product Description

## Utilize the Challenge
Open the file, run npm install for all the fun node packages.  I type npm run develop and this will compile the files to fun a React application.  Once the application is running, you may click on the login/sign up button.  Toggle over to signup if you have not been to the site before.  Enter your username, email and password.  If you have already signed up, you may enter your email and password to log back in and see previously saved books, or you can save more books for future references.
